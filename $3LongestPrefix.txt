Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.


-------------Solution----------------
1)Find the smallest string in the array .
2)find length of that and assign it in variable name as : smallestString and smallestStringSize.
3)So now maximum for loop can be smallestStringSize.
4)at each iteration pick character of iteration number and compare it with each element present in array (by its character).
5)if codnition fail then set flag to fasle break both loop;
6)if now then append in another string .
At the End return that string.
